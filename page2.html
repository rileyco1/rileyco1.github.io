  <p>I chose “Right to Repair” as my cause. I wanted to do something a little less known and felt like this was an issue that’s been flying under the radar for a while. “Right to Repair” refers to a recent legislative push to make things like technical documentation, repair parts, and diagnostic codes more available to customers, mechanics, and technicians. It became an issue because it’s pretty common for these things to be withheld by the companies that made the product, usually through copyrights, user agreements, and other ways all intended to increase the cost to the consumer. It’s obviously a bit more complicated, but I simplified it for the sake of the poster.</p>
  <p>The font in this poster is “Prototype,” which I got from Dafont. The logo was made in Illustrator using text images pulled from Fontawesome. Most of the sites out there for “Right to Repair” use images like a fist holding a wrench or two crossed tools, so I wanted to go in a different direction. The multimeter image was posterized in Photoshop and then the backgrounds deleted in Illustrator. I dropped the screen effect in with Photoshop.</p>
